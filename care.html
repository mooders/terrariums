                        <p>Plants used in Terrariums are shade-loving plants that thrive in humid conditions.</p>
                        <p>
                            Terrariums should not be placed in direct sunlight.  Avoid south facing windows, particularly during summer as this will scorch the plants inside!  However, it is important that the Terrarium has natural light, so somewhere near a window, but out of direct sun would be ideal. 
                            Your Terrarium should be kept in a room between 15 to 27 degrees centigrade.  Keep it away from any radiators or direct sources of heat that cause sudden temperature changes
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once you’ve found the perfect location, your Terrarium will thrive.  Remember though, all plants, even those in Terrariums need air to survive.  We recommended you take the lid off for a few hours every week to refresh the air in the jar.
                        </p>

                        <p class="playwrite-gb-s-h5">Watering Your Terrarium</p>
                        <p>
                            If you have a Closed Terrarium (with a lid), you won’t need to water often.  It should be a maintenance–free, self-sustaining ecosystem.  If the moss and leaves look green and there is a small amount of condensation on the side of the jar, there is no need to water.  If things look a little dry, or the moss starts to yellow, give the plants a few sprays of water.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you have an Open Terrarium (without a lid), a little more water will be required.   The soil should be kept moist.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is better to under-water rather than over-water a Terrarium. The aim is to have some condensation on the glass, but the Terrarium should not be soaking wet.
                        </p>

                        <p class="playwrite-gb-s-h5">Things to watch out for</p>
                        <p>
                            Your Terrarium will need to settle for the first few weeks.  A few leaves may fall or yellow as it gets used to its new home.  Don’t worry about this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>If the foliage continues to yellow after a few weeks</strong>, your Terrarium may not be getting enough light, or it may be over-watered
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>If the soil is waterlogged or there is a lot of condensation on the inside of the glass jar</strong>, keep the cork/lid off for a few days to allow the moisture to evaporate
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>If the soil looks OK and there are a few droplets of moisture visible on the glass</strong>, move your Terrarium to a brighter location, but out of direct sunlight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>If your moss is yellowing or losing its vibrant green colour</strong>, your Terrarium is too dry. Take a spray bottle and give it something to drink.  Don’t over-water though
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>If your plants start to lose their colour or droop</strong>, your Terrarium has too much direct sun. Move your Terrarium to a place with less direct sunlight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>If there is too much condensation on the inside of the jar</strong>, your Terrarium may be getting too much sun, or has too much moisture. Take the lid off and allow some of the moisture to escape. If that doesn't solve the problem, move your Terrarium to a place with less direct sunlight.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The plants in your Terrarium will grow.  You can either keep the plants well-trimmed, or you can let them grow to fill the space.  To trim, use scissors to cut back large leaves or foliage.   Always cut above a leave node (where the leaf comes out of the stem).
